            The first thing I paid attention to was the interactive aspect of

            Changing the content along with the resizing of the browser was a
            technique I had never encountered before and I found that very
            intriguing.

            I spent most time engaging with the “find the secret feature” aspect
            of this experience. I really like interactive aspects of games and
            sites where I can click on objects and receive a response in return,
            it really helps me feel immersed in the environment by allowing
            interactions between me and the scenery.

          <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
          <p>
            I was mostly dragging around the screen, after the tutorial
            explained that there was “secret features” in the environment, it
            prompted me to try and look around the entire scene to find that
            interactive element. Other than that, I read the poems and moved along 
            each page at around the same pace.

                To me, it seemed like the creator wanted the audience to experience 
                “the essence of a summer day” through their perspective. In the 
                introduction page, it is also stated that this site is “a tribute 
                to the grand unveiling of the RM 07-01 coloured ceramics”, which 
                after a quick search; is revealed to be a summer collection of 
                bold-coloured wrist watches.

            <p>
            I feel that this is an experience that can last for quite a while,
            I was able to spent around 10 minutes just to get through the very first section 
            (finishing the Archipelago). However I’m unsure about the replayability of 
            this site as it is quite a simple and straightforward experience. 
            Furthermore, I find that there wasn’t anymore “secret features” in the later 
            pages which made it less engaging.

            <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
            <p>
            It mainly communicates its interactive elements through direct written 
            instructions, implemented into a skippable tutorial. Due to the simple 
            nature of the interactions, not much more is communicated after the 
            tutorial is finished, it’s expected that the user understands how to 
            interact with the rest of the experience once the tutorial is over.

            <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
            <p>
            personally, this experience reminds me a lot of point and click games 
            where you interact with elements on screen to progress the story. Although 
            there was not a lot of interactivity in terms of the elements in the illustrations, 
            the act of having the player experience the story at their own pace reminded me 
            of the role playing games and visual novel genres.

            <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
            <p>
            The site referencing point and click games indicates to the user that they should 
            drag around to explore and interact with the environment, this also makes the experience 
            feel a lot more natural to people who has previous experience playing these sorts of games.

            <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
            <p>
            The reference to point and click games makes the user feel that they should explore and 
            interact with everything in the environment, ensuring that the user is able to explore 
            the environment fully and properly get immersed in the summer atmosphere.

        <div id="fas" class="sectionbox">
        <div class="section"><p>Frustration and satisfaction</p></div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
          <p>
            It was actually slightly frustrating to be forced to drag around the environment rather 
            than having the full environment on a full computer screen. Although I found the resizing 
            browser interaction to be very creative and fun, it was quite irritating to have to drag 
            around the screen to view the full environment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h2>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="height: 200px">Image</div>
          <p>
          The most satisfying part of the interaction was finding the “secret features” (clicking on 
          an object with a dim glow around the edges). The act of interacting with a part of the environment 
          and receiving the “reward” of a short poem gives me a boost of dopamine from that feeling of 
          discovery.
